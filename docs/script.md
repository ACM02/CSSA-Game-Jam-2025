# Ball Game

On a black screen, white text emerges.

> "One must imagine Sisyphus happy."

The text slowly fades away, replaced by the overworld consisting of a 2D world from an isometric angle of a dark, grimy forest. In the middle lies an unmoving boulder. The tiles in front of the boulder are angled upwards, visually raised from the ground where the boulder sat.

From the opposite side, a blob approaches the boulder. It vocalizes:

> "I must push the boulder to the top."

The camera centers on the blob as WASD buttons appear above it, indicating the four directions the blob can move towards. There is nothing behind the blob, if they stray too far away from the boulder, they do not move further but vocalize:

> "I must push the boulder to the top."

If the blob moves towards the boulder, the boulder is pushed in the direction the blob is pushing it from, assuming there is a grid square there. If the boulder is currently on an angled tile, it will roll down the slope until it settles on a flat tile, unless it is blocked by the blob or something else from rolling down said direction. Pushing the boulder drains the blob's stamina; if it runs out of stamina, it faints and returns to its starting position. Stamina recovers over time when the blob is not pushing against anything.

The blob pushes the boulder up the three rows of sloped tiles by simply going forward. Settling on flat ground, it sees a new, bigger slope ahead; however, some tiles have trees on them, blocking the boulder. There is only one column the blob can pushes the boulder upwards to reach the next flat ground, as all the others have at least one tile with a tree on them.

It has just enough stamina to reach the top of the slope, where it is met with a flowing river. With nowhere else to go but up, it continues onwards and gets swallowed by the river as the screen fades to black.

> "I drowned in my sorrows. My lungs suffocate the way they always have."

> "But I must push the boulder to the top."

The blob respawns, now as a fish, alongside the boulder in front of the river. The fish will no longer be drowned by the river; however, the river flow still pushes it and the boulder, and if either falls off the region, the fish faints and respawns. The fish moves faster than the boulder is pushed by the river, so it pushes the boulder onto it, returns to land, and catches up with the boulder to push it onto the other side.

The fish and boulder are challenged by another long ramp with blocking trees and flowing rivers, but with smart utilization of its environment, it manages to push the boulder up the next patch of flat ground without losing all its stamina.

The fish is now met with a patch of mud. It does not have the strength to escape the mud and sinks to the bottom.

> "I foundered into the mire. My legs crumble under the weight of it all."

> "But I must push the boulder to the top."

The fish respawns, now as a reptile, alongside the boulder in front of the mud. The reptile will no longer get stuck in the mud; however, the mud still gradually swallows the reptile and the boulder, and if either is swallowed by being there for too long, the reptile faints and respawn. The boulder takes a reasonable amount of time before getting swallowed by the mud, so the reptile can push it forward before they both gets consumed.

The reptile and boulder are challenged by a ramp with mud puddles and blocking trees, where it must intentionally push the boulder into the puddle, reposition itself to push on the boulder sideways, after which the boulder will slide down another mud puddle and the reptile must reposition under the boulder to push it upwards. The reptile is then challenged by another ramp where it must utilize both the flow of the river and the stopping of the mud to successfully push the boulder to the next flat ground.

The reptile pushes the boulder up another simple ramp before suddenly being lunged at by a vulture sideways, dying.

> "I was visited by the Grim Reaper. They took from me an unbeating heart."

> "But I must push the boulder to the top."

The reptile respawns, now as a human, alongside the boulder in front of the unaware vulture. The vulture, upon noticing, will wait until there is not an obstacle between it and its target before lunging at the primate, with an indicator of where it's aimed at. If it hits the primate, the primate faints and respawns. Else, the vulture gets stunned and stays in place for a few seconds before attacking again; if the boulder rolls over the vulture while it is stunned, it dies permanently.

The human navigates over a few more ramps, where not only must it deals with the environment, but also avoid the vultures that it may strategically choose to kill or just ignore and maneuver around their attacks.

At the end, the human is face-to-face with an impossibly long ramp with no obstacles. It pushes and pushes the boulder upwards, but eventually run out of stamina. Instead of fainting, it is stuck in place, as the screen fades to black.

> "I must push the boulder to the top."

> "There, I hope to find a cliff, where I can push the boulder off and destroy it once and for all."

> "But there is no cliff ahead. It keeps going."

> "I don't have the strength to push anymore."

Three choices appear.

> Stop

> Keep pushing

> Accept

If "Stop" is chosen, the boulder rolls over the human and crushes it, taking them to the start of the ramp.

If "Keep pushing" is chosen, the human tries to push the boulder up the ramp, but its arms snap and the boulder crushes it, taking them to the start of the ramp.

If "Accept" is chosen, the human moves from pushing against the boulder to embracing it, as they merge and become one. The WASD icons appear in front of the boulder that is no longer sliding down the ramp on its own. WASD moves the boulder as it rolls up the ramp itself.

As it reaches the flat ground, where there indeed had been no cliff, the boulder sees color in the forest, instead of the gloomy dark forest it had been stuck in. The boulder stops moving. After a while, a new, different gray blob appears, saying:

> "I must push the boulder to the top."

As it approaches the boulder, the screen fades to black.
